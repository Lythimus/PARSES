#PARSES V0.45
For more information see [wiki](https://github.com/Lythimus/PARSES/wiki)

#Requirements
PARSES is intended to be executed with Solexa data on a *NIX-based desktop computer. It may not be used for any sort of financial gain. Licenses for both MEGAN and Novoalign are strictly for non-profit research at non-profit institutions and academic usage.

##Supported Data Types
* fasta
* sanger
* solexa
* illumina1.3
* illumina1.5

##System Requirements
PARSES's system requirements are directly dependent on the size of the data set being processed. It is recommended to be run on a Linux or OS X 64-bit machine with at least 4GBs of memory. You must also have root privileges to the machine if you are installing software.

##Software Requirements
* 
* Working directory is the directory in which the FASTQ sequence file is contained.
* [gcc](http://adcdownload.apple.com/ios/ios_sdk_4.1__final/xcode_3.2.4_and_ios_sdk_4.1.dmg)
* [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads)
* [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org)
* abyssKmerOptimizer.pl marked as executable in same folder as rakefile
* fac.pl marked as executable in same folder as rakefile
* addTaxon.pl marked as executable in same folder as rakefile
* parallelBlast.sh marked as executable in same folder as rakefile
* Xextractspans.pl marked as executable in same folder as rakefile

#Installation
Execute all commands from the directory of the data. Place all scripts for PARSES into a single directory and mark as executable. All latest versions of programs will be installed, in the event of an error during installation a repository of the programs may be used which is not guaranteed to be up to date. The repository can be activated by including the repo=true command. Installation will automatically be performed during any execution but it can be manually performed by evoking any of the following installation commands:

	sudo rake -f /rake/file/location install #installs and indexes all resources.
	sudo rake -f /rake/file/location novoalignInstall
	sudo rake -f /rake/file/location bowtieInstall
	sudo rake -f /rake/file/location hgInstall
	sudo rake -f /rake/file/location novoIndex
	sudo rake -f /rake/file/location bowtieIndex
	sudo rake -f /rake/file/location samtoolsInstall
	sudo rake -f /rake/file/location tophatInstall
	sudo rake -f /rake/file/location abyssInstall
	sudo rake -f /rake/file/location blastInstall
	sudo rake -f /rake/file/location ntInstall

#Analyzing Results

##MEGAN
The primary method for viewing results involves perusing the RMA file produced by MEGAN--though a PDF is also produced with standard LCA parameters. To familiarize yourself with MEGAN you can watch the [MEGAN Introduction Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7-OCW-DctY).

Your results will resemble the following:

For a detailed example of what results changing LCA parameters will have click the image below (or [here for a PDF version](https://github.com/downloads/Lythimus/PARSES/MEGAN%20LCA%20Parameters%20Example.pdf)).

#Configuration

##PARSES Configuration
A configuration file is produced for PARSES in `$HOME/.PARSES`. It contains the paths to the human genome and NT databases as well as the paths to the Bowtie and TopHat indices. It has the following form:

	--- !ruby/object:Settings
	bowtieIndex: /usr/share/hgChrAll
	humanGenomeDatabase: /usr/share
	novoIndex: /usr/share/hgChrAll.ndx
	ntDatabase: /usr/share/nt/nt

##Sequence Configuration
In addition, configuation files are produced for each sequence in `$(pwd)/.sequenceName`. Settings for each program are chosen by default but can be changed via the sequence file which has the following form:

	--- !ruby/object:Sequence
	abyssPath: s_4_sequence_Akata.txt.novo.NM.fasta.nospans.blast.megan.rma
	abyssPathGlob: reads-*.fasta
	blast1Path: s_4_sequence_Akata.txt.novo.NM.fasta.nospans
	blast2Path: s_4_sequence_Akata.txt.novo.NM.fasta.nospans.blast.megan.rma.kmerOptimized.fa
	blastOutputFormat: 0
	blastPathGlob: reads-*.fasta.*.kmer.contigs.fa.kmerOptimized.fa
	dataType: illumina1.3
	eValue1: 1.0e-06
	eValue2: 100
	expansionNumber: 10
	filePath: s_4_sequence_Akata.txt
	imageFileType: jpg
	maxKmerLength: 38
	maxMatches: 0
	megan1Path: s_4_sequence_Akata.txt.novo.NM.fasta.nospans.blast
	megan2Path: s_4_sequence_Akata.txt.novo.NM.fasta.nospans.blast.megan.rma.kmerOptimized.fa.blast
	minKmerLength: 7
	minScoreByLength: 0
	minSupport: 5
	novoalignPath: s_4_sequence_Akata.txt.novo
	pipeEndPath: s_4_sequence_Akata.txt.novo.NM.fasta.nospans.blast.megan.rma.kmerOptimized.fa.blast.megan.rma
	readLength: 38
	removeNonMappedPath: s_4_sequence_Akata.txt.novo.NM.fasta
	topPercent: 10.0
	useCogs: "false"
	useGos: "false"
	winScore: 0.0

It is recommended the path variables not be adjusted. Everything except expansionNumber, which is the number of times to execute the expansion command when generating a picture from MEGAN is straight-forward.

##System Configuration
In addition, the amount of RAM, number of CPU cores, CPU architecture, operating system, default shell, and existence of locate database is automatically computed each execution but not stored.
